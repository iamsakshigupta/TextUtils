# TextUtils

TextUtils is a web application that allows users to interact with text content in various ways. Whether you need to change the case of text, clear it, or view statistics about it, this tool provides a simple and user-friendly interface to perform these actions. Additionally, the project supports a dark mode for enhanced readability.

- **Clear:** The "Clear" button allows you to remove all the text from the input area.
- **Text Statistics:** The tool provides valuable information about the entered text:
  - Word Count: Displays the number of words in the text.
  - Character Count: Shows the total number of characters, including spaces and special characters.
  - Reading Time: Estimates the time required to read the text based on an average reading speed of 0.008 minutes per word.

## Technology Stack

- Frontend Framework: React
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- State Management: React `useState`

## Usage

Users can enter or paste text into the input area. They can then apply transformations like changing the case or clearing the text. The tool provides instant feedback, allowing users to view text statistics and the transformed content. The dark mode option enhances readability in different lighting conditions.

## Why Use This Tool

- Quickly manipulate text without the need for external software or code.
- Get insights into the structure and length of text content.
- Enhance the user experience with a dark mode option.

## Future Enhancements

We have plans to make TextUtils even more powerful and user-friendly in the future:

- Implement additional text transformation options (e.g., title case, sentence case).
- Add support for uploading text files.
- Improve the user interface for better usability.
